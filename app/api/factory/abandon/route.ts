/**
 * Factory Abandon API Endpoint
 * Created: 2025-10-17
 * 
 * OVERVIEW:
 * POST endpoint for abandoning a player-owned factory. Resets factory to
 * unclaimed state (Level 1, no owner), allowing player to free up a factory
 * slot when at the 10-factory limit. Strategic repositioning tool.
 * 
 * REQUEST BODY:
 * {
 *   "factoryX": number,      // Factory X coordinate
 *   "factoryY": number       // Factory Y coordinate
 * }
 * 
 * RESPONSE:
 * {
 *   "success": true,
 *   "message": "Factory abandoned successfully",
 *   "factory": Factory,      // Reset factory (Level 1, no owner)
 *   "factoriesOwned": number // Updated count of owned factories
 * }
 * 
 * VALIDATION:
 * - User must be authenticated
 * - Factory must exist at coordinates
 * - Factory must be owned by user
 * 
 * ABANDON BEHAVIOR:
 * - Owner set to null (becomes unclaimed)
 * - Level reset to 1
 * - Slots reset to base capacity (10)
 * - usedSlots reset to 0
 * - Defense unchanged (tile property)
 * - All player units at factory are LOST
 * 
 * USE CASES:
 * - Player at 10-factory limit wants to claim better location
 * - Strategic withdrawal from vulnerable position
 * - Consolidating production to fewer locations
 * - Abandoning low-level factories to invest in high-level ones

/**
 * IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
 * 
 * 1. Abandon Consequences:
 *    - Factory becomes immediately claimable by anyone
 *    - All upgrade progress lost (no refund)
 *    - All units produced at factory are deleted
 *    - Player's STR/DEF totals updated accordingly
 * 
 * 2. Strategic Considerations:
 *    - Abandoning is permanent and costly
 *    - Should only be done when repositioning is critical
 *    - High-level factories represent significant investment
 *    - UI should show confirmation dialog before abandoning
 * 
 * 3. Unit Handling:
 *    - Units are tracked by factory coordinates
 *    - Abandoning factory deletes all its units
 *    - Player's total army stats are recalculated
 *    - Response includes units lost count for feedback
 * 
 * 4. Factory Limit Management:
 *    - Abandoning frees a factory slot (if at 10 limit)
 *    - Response includes updated factory count
 *    - Allows strategic reallocation of factory slots
 * 
 * 5. Future Enhancements:
 *    - Could add "relocate units" option before abandoning
 *    - Could add partial refund of upgrade costs
 *    - Could add cooldown period before re-claiming
 *    - Could add "downgrade" option instead of full abandon
