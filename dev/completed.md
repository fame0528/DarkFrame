**Description:**
Final session cleanup fixing critical authentication bug, layout consistency across pages, and removing non-existent "gold" currency from stats system. Added comprehensive layout standards documentation.

**Fixes Completed:**
1. **WMD Authentication Bug (CRITICAL)**
   - Issue: All WMD endpoints returning 401 errors
   - Root Cause: `/lib/wmd/apiHelpers.ts` expected `payload.userId` but JWT contains `payload.username`
   - Fix: Changed line 56 from `payload.userId` to `payload.username`
   - Impact: All WMD API endpoints now authenticate properly

2. **Unit Factory Layout**
   - Added TopNavBar and GameLayout (3-panel structure)
   - Implemented "Max" button for unit building (considers metal, energy, AND available slots)
   - Fixed container sizing: `h-full w-full overflow-auto` with proper background

3. **Layout Standardization**
   - Verified all 6 GameLayout pages use proper container sizing
   - Fixed unit-factory using `max-w-7xl` constraints (wastes space in 3-panel layout)
   - Standard pattern: `h-full w-full overflow-auto bg-gradient-to-b from-gray-900 to-black`

4. **Stats System Economy Alignment**
   - Removed all "gold" references from stats page and API
   - Changed `PlayerStat.gold` → `PlayerStat.metal`
   - Changed `GameStats.totalGold` → `GameStats.totalMetal` + added `totalEnergy`
   - Updated sort options: 'gold' → 'metal'
   - Added 4th stat card for Total Energy (grid now 2x2 on medium, 4 cols on large)
   - API now flattens `resources.metal` and `resources.energy` to top-level fields

**Files Modified:**
- `/lib/wmd/apiHelpers.ts` - JWT field fix
- `/app/game/unit-factory/page.tsx` - Layout + Max button + container sizing
- `/app/stats/page.tsx` - Removed gold, added metal/energy
- `/app/api/stats/route.ts` - Updated sort logic and data projection
- `/dev/lessons-learned.md` - Added Lesson #34 (GameLayout standards)

**Documentation Added:**
- Lesson #34: GameLayout Container Requirements
- Standard pattern for all pages using GameLayout
- Why `max-w-7xl` breaks 3-panel layouts
- Verified pattern across all 6 pages

**Acceptance Criteria:** ALL MET ✅
- ✅ WMD endpoints authenticate successfully (401 errors resolved)
- ✅ Unit factory has 3-panel layout with Max button
- ✅ All GameLayout pages verified for proper sizing
- ✅ No "gold" references in stats system
- ✅ Stats display metal and energy correctly
- ✅ 0 TypeScript errors
