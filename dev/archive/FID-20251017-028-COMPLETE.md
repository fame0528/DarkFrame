# ✅ Leaderboard Privacy & Asset Guide Updates - FID-20251017-028

**Date:** 2025-10-17  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  
**Priority:** 🟢 MEDIUM  

---

## 📋 **CHANGES MADE**

### **1. ✅ Leaderboard Privacy - Hide STR/DEF**
**File:** `app/leaderboard/page.tsx`

**Rationale:** STR/DEF values are tactical information that should remain private to prevent other players from targeting weak opponents or avoiding strong ones.

**Changes:**
- **Removed columns:** Strength, Defense, Factories
- **Added column:** Level
- **Kept columns:** Rank, Player, Effective Power, Balance

**Before (7 columns):**
```
Rank | Player | Effective Power | Strength | Defense | Factories | Balance
```

**After (5 columns):**
```
Rank | Player | Effective Power | Level | Balance
```

---

### **2. ✅ Show Player Level Instead of Factories**
**Changes:**
- Replaced "Factories" column with "Level" column
- Shows player's experience level (⭐ icon)
- Displays in current player rank card too
- Public information that shows progression without tactical details

**Visual:**
```
⭐ Level 5
```

---

### **3. ✅ Number Formatting with Commas**
**Already Implemented:** All numbers already use `.toLocaleString()` for comma formatting

**Examples:**
- `1234567` → `1,234,567`
- `98765` → `98,765`
- `1000` → `1,000`

**Applied to:**
- Effective Power
- Factory counts (in player card)
- All large numbers throughout leaderboard

---

### **4. ✅ Multiple Asset Variations Guide**
**File:** `ASSET_STORAGE_GUIDE.md` (+180 lines)

**Added comprehensive documentation for:**

shrine-club.png       ← Club tier active
shrine-all.png        ← All 4 tiers active
```

#### **Recommended Variation Counts**

|---------|-------|--------|
| Forests | 3-5 | High variety for rare tiles |

## 🎯 **PRIVACY BENEFITS**

### **What's Hidden:**
- ❌ **Total Strength** - Attackers can't see your offensive power
- ❌ **Total Defense** - Attackers can't gauge your defenses
- ❌ **Factory Count** - Competitors can't track your economy

### **What's Public:**
- ✅ **Effective Power** - Overall strength indicator (balance-adjusted)
- ✅ **Level** - Shows experience and progression
- ✅ **Balance Status** - Shows if player is optimizing STR/DEF ratio
- ✅ **Rank** - Competitive position

### **Strategic Advantages:**
1. **No Cherry-Picking:** Strong players can't avoid each other
2. **No Easy Targets:** Weak players not easily identified
3. **Economy Mystery:** Factory production capacity hidden
4. **Tactical Surprise:** Actual STR/DEF composition unknown
5. **Level Progression:** Players can still show off experience
